## ðŸ“– How It Works

### Loading an Excel File
1. Click on **File > Open** to load an `.xlsx` file.
2. The application will:
   - Parse the first worksheet of the file.
   - Display all rows and columns in `ListView1`.
   - Populate unique values in the combo boxes (`Location`, `SKU`, `Movable Unit Label`) for filtering.

### Filtering Data
1. Use the combo boxes to filter data dynamically.
2. Filters are applied to the data in `ListView1` based on:
   - `Location`
   - `SKU`
   - `Movable Unit Label`
3. The filtering logic waits 2 seconds after typing to avoid triggering multiple searches unnecessarily.

### Exporting Filtered Data
1. Enter the `Location` prefix (e.g., `A1`, `B2`) in the `Location Filter` textbox.
2. Click the **Export Location** button.
3. Choose the desired export style:
   - **Basic**: A plain and clean table.
   - **Modern**: Enhanced with CSS for professional presentation.
4. The filtered data will be:
   - Exported as an HTML file to your **Desktop**.
   - Automatically opened in your default web browser.

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Use Case: Cycle Counting in a 3PL Environment

1. **Load Data**:
   - Import an Excel inventory report exported from your Warehouse Management System (WMS).
2. **Filter**:
   - Use the combo boxes to focus on specific `Location` ranges (e.g., `A1-01` to `A1-50`) or filter by `SKU` and `Movable Unit Label`.
3. **Export**:
   - Export the filtered data into a clean HTML table for printing or sharing with your team.
   - The table includes an empty `Action` column for employees to manually mark items as counted or inspected.
